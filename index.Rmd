The `betfaiR` package will eventually provide R users full access to the Betfair API, retrieving data and placing bets.  

The **primary** function of the package is [`betfair`](betfair.html) which requires users to enter their login details, including an API key (see Betfair [documentation](https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Application+Keys) on how to get an API key).  The function returns an environment with various methods for querying and retrieving data from Betfair.

This is not to say that it is the only way to use this package, all the functions that `betfair` uses are available, but `betfair` aims to keep the workspace free of unnecessary variables as queries are developed and saved.
