title: "cron jobs w/ betfaiR"
---

This vignette will walk through the (theoretical) use of `betfaiR` to collect data over time - this will be useful for collecting data about markets, to potentially build models and establish trading strategies.  I will attempt to explain how to perform similar tasks on both Windows and Linux/OSX machines, this will involve creating an R script and using a Task scheduler (Task Scheduler on Windows and cronjobs on Linux/OSX).
