This vignette will walk through the use of `betfaiR` to collect data over time - the markets we will focus on is the match odds markets for Man City vs Spurs and Arsenal vs Leicester, as well as the Premier League outright market.  However this approach can be used for collecting data about other markets, to potentially build models and establish trading strategies.

I will try to explain how to perform similar tasks on both Windows and Linux/OSX machines, this will involve creating an R script and using a Task scheduler (Task Scheduler on Windows and [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) on Linux/OSX); this [blog](https://trinkerrstuff.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/scheduling-r-tasks-via-windows-task-scheduler/) by [Tyler Rinker](https://twitter.com/tylerrinker) has been very useful to me.

As an example, the plot below shows the minute by minute Betfair price data during the course of a football match between Manchester United and Manchester City:

There are a few things that we will need to do:

* to create an R script that will use changing variables
    * variables will be the marketIds which will change day to day
* to store data in .RDS or RData files, data will include
    * marketId
    * returned market data

## Find markets

First, some familiarity with events, competitions, and markets will help with creating an R script to automate the collection of data.  As we are focussing on the Premier League, we need an eventTypeId, a competitionId, which will help us to find the markets we are interested in.

```{r login-and-search}
# load betfaiR and login
library(betfaiR)
bf <- betfair(usr = Sys.getenv("BETFAIR_USR"),
              pwd = Sys.getenv("BETFAIR_PWD"),
              key = Sys.getenv("BETFAIR_KEY"))

# find correct eventTypeIds
eventTypeIds <- bf$eventTypes()
eventTypeIds[grepl("soccer|football", eventTypeIds$eventType_name, ignore.case = TRUE),]
# soccer/football has eventTypeId of 1, lets use that along with marketCountries to find the Premier League competition
competitions <- bf$competitions(filter = marketFilter(eventTypeIds = 1,
                                                      marketCountries = "GB"))
competitions[grepl("premier", competitions$competition_name, ignore.case =  TRUE),]
# the Premier League has a competition id of 31, we can find the different market types for this competition
marketTypes <- bf$marketTypes(filter = marketFilter(competitionIds = 31))
```
```{r show-marketTypes, echo=FALSE}
marketTypes[grepl("WINNER|MATCH_ODDS", marketTypes$marketType),]
```

The marketIds of the two matches (Man City vs Spurs and Arsenal vs Leicester) and the outright winner of the Premier League are shown below:

The following are the three markets of interest, which were collected and saved sometime on Weds 10th Feb 2016.

```{r show-markets, echo=FALSE}
marketIds <- readRDS("vignette_two/marketIds.RDS")
plyr::l_ply(marketIds, summary)
```

## R script

A script will need to login, find the correct markets, retreive the relevant data, and then save the data.  The process of finding the correct markets needn't be repeated time after time, so this data can be retrieved once, saved and then loaded every time.  Although the script needs to be able to run straight off the bat, so it might look something like the code below:

```{r example-login, eval=FALSE}
library(betfaiR)

bf <- betfair(usr = Sys.getenv("BETFAIR_USR"),
              pwd = Sys.getenv("BETFAIR_PWD"),
              key = Sys.getenv("BETFAIR_KEY"))

files <- list.files()

if(!("marketIds.RDS" %in% files)) {
    cittot <- bf$marketCatalogue(filter = marketFilter(competitionIds = 31,
                                                       textQuery = "Tottenham",
                                                       to = "2016-02-15",
                                                       marketTypeCodes = "MATCH_ODDS"),
                                 maxResults = 10)
    arslei <- bf$marketCatalogue(filter = marketFilter(competitionIds = 31,
                                                       textQuery = "Arsenal",
                                                       to = "2016-02-15",
                                                       marketTypeCodes = "MATCH_ODDS"),
                                 maxResults = 10)
    winner <- bf$marketCatalogue(filter = marketFilter(competitionIds = 31,
                                                       marketTypeCodes = "WINNER"))
    marketIds <- list(cittot = cittot, arslei = arslei, winner = winner)
    saveRDS(marketIds, "marketIds.RDS")
} else {
    marketIds <- readRDS("marketIds.RDS")
}
```

## part two - findings

I will try to post a follow up vignette/blog with some basic analysis of the data returned by the markets...
